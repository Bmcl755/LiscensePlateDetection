My extension separates the numberplate from the original image and displays just the number plate as well as creating an output image of the seperate numberplate, I wanted to seperate this as it allowed for analysis of the numberplate by itself. This would also allow for easier number and letter extraction as there is more focus on the numberplate and very little of anything else. This could also result in better storage possibilties as the image is smaller so in the scenario where multiple numberplates from multiple pictures are required more can be saved in storage.
